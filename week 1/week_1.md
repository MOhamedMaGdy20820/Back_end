# `definitions`

    1. URL:
    URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a string of characters that provides a unique address for a web page or resource on the internet. URLs typically start with "http://" or "https://" and are followed by a domain name or IP address, a path, and sometimes parameters or queries. They allow users to access specific web pages and resources by typing or clicking on the URL.

    2. Domain Name:
    A domain name is a unique name or identifier used to identify a website or a network domain on the internet. It's a user-friendly way of representing the IP address of a web server or network.
    Domain names are used by web browsers and other applications to locate and access websites on the internet

    3. IP Address:
    URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a string of characters that provides a unique address for a web page or resource on the internet. URLs typically start with "http://" or "https://" and are followed by a domain name or IP address, a path, and sometimes parameters or queries. They allow users to access specific web pages and resources by typing or clicking on the URL.

    4. Mac address:
    a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network. Primarily specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing, the MAC address is often found on a device's network interface card

    5. DNS:
    A Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources. Every device on the internet has an IP address, which other devices can use to locate the device.

    6. Data Center:
    A data center is a large facility or building that is designed to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. Data centers are used to store, manage, process, and distribute large amounts of data, and they play a critical role in the operation of many modern businesses and organizations.
    Data centers typically have a large number of servers, storage devices, network switches, routers, and other hardware equipment that are used to process and store data. They are designed to provide a secure and controlled environment for these components, with features such as backup power supplies, cooling systems, and fire suppression systems to ensure reliable operation.

    7. client:
    any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server

    8. server:
    A server is a computer system or a program that provides data, services, or resources to other computers or devices, known as clients, over a network. In other words, a server is a device or a software application that serves other devices or applications on a network.

    9. request and respons:
    request: a request is a message sent by a client, typically a web browser, to a server requesting some information or resource. For example, when a user types a URL into a web browser's address bar, the browser sends a request to the server hosting that URL, asking for the corresponding webpage to be sent back.

    response: Once the server receives the request, it generates a response, which is the data or resource that the client requested. The response typically includes the requested webpage, along with any other resources needed to display it correctly, such as images, scripts, or stylesheets. The response is then sent back to the client, where it is displayed in the web browser or processed by another application.

    10. Internet:
    The internet is a global network of computers and other electronic devices connected together, allowing people from all over the world to communicate and exchange information. It is a decentralized network, which means that there is no central authority controlling it. The internet allows users to access a vast amount of information and services, such as email, social media, online shopping, video conferencing, and more.

    11. web:
    The web, short for World Wide Web, is a collection of interconnected web pages and other digital content that can be accessed via the internet.

    12. HTTP:
    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol, or set of rules, that defines how data is transmitted over the World Wide Web. HTTP is the foundation of communication between web browsers and web servers.

    13. TCP:
    TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which is a standard communication protocol used by devices to communicate with each other over the internet. TCP is one of the core protocols in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, which is the set of protocols used to transmit data over the internet.
    TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices. It does this by breaking the data down into packets and sending them over the internet in a way that ensures they are delivered in the correct order and without errors. TCP also includes mechanisms for flow control, congestion control, and error recovery to ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably.

    14. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
        1. HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to structure and define the content of web pages. HTML provides a set of tags that define        
        headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and other types of content. HTML determines the basic structure and layout of a web page.

        2. CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to define the visual style and layout of web pages. CSS allows developers to specify the colors,fonts, spacing, 
        and other visual aspects of web pages, independent of the content itself. CSS can be used to create complex page layouts and responsive designs  that adapt to different 
        screen sizes.

        3. JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is used to add interactivity, behavior, and             
        functionality to web pages. JavaScript can be used to create animations, validate forms, update page content without reloading, and interact with APIs and       other 
        web services.

        In summary, HTML defines the content and structure of a web page, CSS defines the visual style and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality. 
        All three technologies work together to create modern web applications.

    15. host headers
    it allows web servers to host multiple domains on a single IP address. When a client sends a request with a specific Host header, the server uses that header to  determine which website to serve the request for.
    Without the Host header, the server wouldn't know which website to serve the request for, and the client would not be able to access the desired website.
    
# `different between web and internet`

The web and the internet are related but distinct concepts:

- The internet refers to the global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using a standardized set of protocols and technologies. It's a vast network that allows devices to communicate and share data with each other.

- The web, on the other hand, is a subset of the internet that consists of web pages and other resources that can be accessed using a web browser. The web is built on top of the internet and uses protocols like HTTP to transmit data between web servers and clients.

In other words, the internet is the underlying infrastructure that allows devices to connect and communicate with each other, while the web is one of the applications that run on top of the internet.

# `How the internet work`

The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that use standardized communication protocols to transmit and exchange data. Here's a high-level overview of how the internet works:

1. Devices connected to the internet, such as computers, smartphones, and servers, use the Internet Protocol (IP) to communicate with each other. Each device has a unique IP address that identifies it on the network.

2. When you type a web address, or URL, into a web browser, the browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the URL into an IP address. The DNS server looks up the IP address associated with the URL and returns it to the browser.

3. The browser uses the IP address to connect to the web server hosting the website, sending an HTTP request for the website's content.

4. The web server processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the browser over the internet. The response includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that the browser uses to display the website.

5. If the website contains additional resources, such as images or videos, the browser sends additional requests to the web server for those resources. The server responds with the requested resources, and the browser displays them on the page.

6. The data transmitted between devices on the internet is broken down into packets, which are small units of data that are sent individually and reassembled at the destination. The internet uses a set of standardized protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol), to ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

7. The packets travel across multiple networks and routers on the internet, each of which forwards the packets to the next hop on the path to their destination. This process continues until the packets reach their destination device.

# How The Web Works ?

The World Wide Web, or simply "the web," is a vast network of interconnected documents and resources that are accessed via the internet. When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into your web browser or click on a link, you're initiating a request to access a specific web page. Here's a high-level overview of how the web works:

1. You enter a URL or click on a link in your web browser, which sends a request to the web server for the requested resource.

2. The web server receives the request and responds with the requested resource, usually an HTML file.

3. Your web browser receives the HTML file and begins to render the content, which may include text, images, videos, and other resources referenced in the HTML.

4. The web browser may need to make additional requests to fetch these resources, which could be hosted on the same server or on other servers around the world.

5. As the web page is rendered, JavaScript code may run to add interactivity and functionality to the page.

6. Once the page is fully loaded and rendered, you can interact with the content and navigate to other pages by clicking on links or typing in new URLs.

# `methods of http`
1. GET: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. The request sent by the client contains a URL and some optional parameters. The server responds with the requested data, usually in the form of an HTML page or a JSON object.<br>
2. POST: This method is used to submit data to the server. The request sent by the client contains the data to be submitted, usually in the form of a form or a JSON object. The server responds with a confirmation message or some other response data.<br>
3. PUT: This method is used to update an existing resource on the server. The request sent by the client contains the new data to be stored on the server. The server replaces the existing data with the new data.<br>
4. DELETE: This method is used to delete an existing resource on the server. The request sent by the client contains the URL of the resource to be deleted. The server removes the resource from its storage<br>

# `host in http request`

In an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request, the "Host" header is used to specify the domain name or IP address of the web server that the client wants to communicate with.

When a client sends an HTTP request to a server, it includes a Host header to indicate which server it wants to connect to. The Host header is mandatory in HTTP/1.1, which is the most commonly used version of the protocol today.

For example, suppose a client wants to request a webpage from the example.com domain. The HTTP request would include a Host header that specifies the domain name, like this:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

In this example, the Host header specifies that the client is requesting the index.html file from the example.com domain.

The Host header is important because it allows web servers to host multiple domains on a single IP address. When a client sends a request with a specific Host header, the server uses that header to determine which website to serve the request for.

Without the Host header, the server wouldn't know which website to serve the request for, and the client would not be able to access the desired website.

# `different between http/1.1 and http2`

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are two different versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that are used to transmit data over the internet. The main differences between the two versions are:

1. Multiplexing: In HTTP/1.1, each request and response between the client and server had to be sent over a separate connection. In HTTP/2, multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection using a technique called "multiplexing." This reduces the number of connections needed between the client and server, and can improve performance.

2. Binary format: HTTP/1.1 uses a text-based format for transmitting data, which can be inefficient and require extra processing time for parsing. HTTP/2 uses a binary format, which is more compact and faster to process.

3. Server push: In HTTP/1.1, the server could only respond to client requests. In HTTP/2, the server can proactively push data to the client without the client having to explicitly request it. This can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips needed to load a page.

4. Header compression: In HTTP/1.1, headers were sent in plain text with each request and response. In HTTP/2, headers are compressed, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted and improving performance.

5. Prioritization: In HTTP/2, the client can specify the order in which requests should be processed by the server, allowing more important requests to be processed first and improving overall performance.

Overall, HTTP/2 is designed to improve the performance of web applications by reducing latency, improving efficiency, and enabling new features like server push. However, it requires both the client and server to support the new protocol, and some older clients or servers may not be compatible with HTTP/2.
